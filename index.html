            <ul>
              <li><em>His Early Life</em></li>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>1912</strong> - Turing was born in London, England.</li>
                <li><strong>1926</strong> - Enrolled into Sherborn Middle School and showed great talents in science and maths.</li>
                <li><strong>1927</strong> - He wrote a book to help his mother to understand Albert Eistein's theory of relativity. He has already showed that he had a mind of great capacity.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><em>His Life in Science</em></li>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>1931</strong> - He was admiited to Cambridge and earned a scholarship for excellent maths skills.</li>
                <li><strong>1936</strong> - He became one of the most reknowened graduates in King's College.</li>
                <li><strong>1937</strong> - He published a paper about the World-famous "Turing Machine". He also published some other to make the theory of computer more reliable.</li>
                <li><strong>1939</strong> - He got his Ph.D in Princeton. What he found there also had a profound influence on the modern computing theory. This year, he also helped decode the Nazi's coding system.</li>

              </ul>
              <li><em>After WW2</em></li>
              <ul>

                <li><strong>1948</strong> - He worked in Manchester as a mathmetician and a computer scientist.</li>
                <li><strong>1950</strong> - He published something related to AI, and he also invented his famous "Turing Test" for AI.</li>
                <li><strong>1952</strong> - He got terribly persecuted for being homosexual.</li>
                <li><strong>1954</strong> - Found dead in his house. Later investigation suggested that it was suicide. He left the famous half-biten apple.</li>

                    to whose unique contribution helped to turn the tide of war. The debt of gratitude he is owed makes it all the more horrifying, therefore, that he was treated so inhumanely."</p>
